### Project setup
- First of all create a Cordova project with cordova commands.

```
npm install -g cordova
cordova create <app-name>
```

- After that download this project (do not clone it!).
- Then copy the content of /vue3cordova-main folder inside your previous cordova project folder.
- Overwrite the files.
- If you can't copy hidden files, don't worry, you can copy manually from this repo!
- Then launch:

```
npm install
```

After you must start:

```
npm run add:platforms
```

In this way the platforms folders will be added to your project.

Then launch the build commands to overwrite the /www default folders of cordova with Vue contents.

```
npm run build
```

---

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
You can start your development with following npm scripts:

```
npm run serve // this will serve only on browser as Vue default serve.
```
```
npm run serve:ios // this will run serve on localhost:8080 and will open your iOS device at the same time.
```
```
npm run serve:android // this will run serve on localhost:8080 and will open your Android device at the same time.
```

---

### Compiles and minifies for production
Launch at first: 
```
npm run build // this will build in /www folder
```

Then use classic cordova commands:

```
cordova build ios
cordova build android
```
To build your mobile application.

### Tips and Problems

- If you have some trouble with _serve_ commands you can cancel the following files from /www folder: _cordova.js_ _cordova_plugins.js_. Then you re-run serve command and it will be created again.

- If you want use cordova on browser you need to copy _cordova.js_ and _cordova_plugins.js_ into your /public folder. Then restart the serve commands.
